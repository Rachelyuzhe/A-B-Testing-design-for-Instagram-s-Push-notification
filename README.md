# A-B-Testing-design-for-Instagram-s-Push-notification

Push notifications are an important tool to help Instagram improve user engagement and deliver more ads to users. The purpose of this experiment is to improve the efficiency of push notifications from the aspect of notification content. We want to know what push content has better performance in improving user engagement and ads revenue. We could assign the one that has better performance more weight in Instagramâ€™s push notification algorithm in the future.
